This requires the heart to work harder than usual to circulate blood through the blood vessels.

Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-140mmHg systolic (top reading) and 60-90mmHg diastolic (bottom reading). High blood pressure is said to be present if it is persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attacks), heart failure, aneurysms of the arteries (e.g. aortic aneurysm), and peripheral arterial disease.",

It generally occurs when a blood clot completely obstructs a coronary artery supplying blood to the heart muscle. The blood clot that causes the heart attack usually forms at the site of rupture of an atherosclerotic, cholesterol plaque on the inner wall of a coronary artery. The most common symptom of heart attack is chest pain. The risk factors for heart attack include high cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, tobacco use, diabetes, male gender, and a family history of heart attacks at an early age.",

The kidney may come from a deceased organ donor or from a living donor. Family members or individuals who are unrelated but make a good match may be able to donate one of their kidneys. This type of transplant is called a living transplant. Individuals who donate a kidney can live healthy lives with the remaining kidney.<br>A person receiving a transplant usually receives only one kidney, but, in rare situations, he or she may receive two kidneys from a deceased donor. In most cases, the diseased kidneys are left in place during the transplant procedure. The transplanted kidney is implanted in the lower abdomen on the front side of the body.",

Each kidney contains up to a million functioning units called nephrons. A nephron consists of a filtering unit of tiny blood vessels called a glomerulus attached to a tubule. When blood enters the glomerulus, it is filtered and the remaining fluid then passes along the tubule. In the tubule, chemicals and water are either added to or removed from this filtered fluid according to the body's needs, the final product being the urine we excrete.",

In case of cancer, the blood production process is interrupted due to the growth of an abnormal type of blood cell.

Nice pretty and lovable in every sense of word. As me and my husband said bare of any sentiment the word ‘Love you’ isn't enough at this moment for her. A new word should be invented to express our emotions! What we can say is: thank you for everything. Me and My Husband came from London UK and we were trying to have baby for 5 years before we meet her. After 2 failed IVF in London Hammersmith Hospital, I had lost all my hope and emotionally disturbed. Now I'm pregnant and we know we succeeded because of your love and care. I will never forget what she have done for us. Once again, I would like to thank you and Dr. Surian Singhal, Dr. Manish , Sister Sophia , Sister Nice and Tanmana Metra. Mrs S S & Mr H O M",

John had his surgery on Tuesday, and by Sunday morning he was well enough to sit in a plane on a 5-hour trip to Singapore. The facilities of Max Hospital Saket is world-class. But as a famous general once said, 'battles are fought with tanks but won by men'. Dr. Chowbey's skills need no introduction but what impressed me more is the commitment of the team of people, and the human touch that is everywhere. And this starts from the top! Kudos to the management of Max Specialty and to Dr. Pradeep Chowbey and Ms. Aenu Batra for leading their dedicated team!",

As you may remember my surgery has yielded a perfect result. Not only was the operation a total success but my life has changed dramatically in the last year. All pre-op symptoms are gone. Period. Of course I have quit all meds. I am in better condition physically than I have been in for a decade or more. At 50 I am preparing for my second life with much enthusiasm. I can say without any doubt that traveling to India for this surgery was the single most important decision I have ever made (next to my darling wife of course) and would do it all again. I owe all who helped me a great debt of gratitude which I can never repay. You have effected me to my core. The old Marc was left in India without regret. I have told my story to many in hopes they may experience similar life saving care. They may not come but I spread the good news none the less. I have only seen my doctor once in the last year. There has been no need. At some point I would like to see a new x-ray to see what my spine looks like now but in my heart it seems insignificant next to the way I feel. It is impossible for me to tell I have parts in there. Great job. I thank you, My family thanks you and I am certain karma will reward you for the rest of your lives. I shall never forget!",
