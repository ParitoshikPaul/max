We were fortunate we found Dr. Chowbey on the web and he accepted John as his patient. When we arrived at Max Super Specialty Hospital, Saket on Monday, we were well guided by Ms. Aenu Batra, Executive Assistant to Dr. Chowbey. John had his surgery on Tuesday, and by Sunday morning he was well enough to sit in a plane on a 5-hour trip to Singapore. The facilities of Max Hospital Saket is world-class. But as a famous general once said, 'battles are fought with tanks but won by men'. Dr. Chowbey's skills need no introduction but what impressed me more is the commitment of the team of people, and the human touch that is everywhere. And this starts from the top! Kudos to the management of Max Specialty and to Dr. Pradeep Chowbey and Ms. Aenu Batra for leading their dedicated team!</p></div></div><div class="container-testimonial"><div class="wrapper-testimonial"><p class="name">Rendell Nugent</p><p class="treatment">Microdisectomy</p><p class="line"></p><p class="description">If you are looking at this video and thinking whether you should be treated at Max Healthcare, then I totally recommend it. The genuine care and affection we got at Max Healthcare is just unmatched! It was very reassuring for my family to know that while I was to go through a surgery, I was being looked after so well. It brings down the stress level so much. And in less than a week, I am feeling free. The Staff is great and the rooms are immaculate. We were in fact treated like guests from the moment we stepped-in.

I am fine and well and I can assure you that I feel completely healed. I am still doing some exercises to keep fit. I have been able to travel outside the country on 2 occassions since I left the hospital to attend meetings and I can assure you that I have been ok.

Just wanted to drop you a note of thanks again. As you may remember my surgery has yielded a perfect result. Not only was the operation a total success but my life has changed dramatically in the last year. All pre-op symptoms are gone. Period. Of course I have quit all meds. I am in better condition physically than I have been in for a decade or more. At 50 I am preparing for my second life with much enthusiasm. I can say without any doubt that traveling to India for this surgery was the single most important decision I have ever made (next to my darling wife of course) and would do it all again. I owe all who helped me a great debt of gratitude which I can never repay. You have effected me to my core. The old Marc was left in India without regret. I have told my story to many in hopes they may experience similar life saving care. They may not come but I spread the good news none the less. I have only seen my doctor once in the last year. There has been no need. At some point I would like to see a new x-ray to see what my spine looks like now but in my heart it seems insignificant next to the way I feel. It is impossible for me to tell I have parts in there. Great job. I thank you, My family thanks you and I am certain karma will reward you for the rest of your lives. I shall never forget!</p></div></div><div class="container-testimonial"><div class="wrapper-testimonial"><p class="name">Rosina Usatch</p><p class="treatment">Orthopaedic Surgery</p><p class="line"></p><p class="description">Faced with severe orthopaedic problems in her lower limbs, Ms. Usatch came to Max Healthcare following recommendations from various quarters in her hometown in Canada.

Just wanted to drop you a note of thanks again. As you may remember my surgery has yielded a perfect result. Not only was the operation a total success but my life has changed dramatically in the last year. All pre-op symptoms are gone. Period. Of course I have quit all meds. I am in better condition physically than I have been in for a decade or more. At 50 I am preparing for my second life with much enthusiasm. I can say without any doubt that traveling to India for this surgery was the single most important decision I have ever made (next to my darling wife of course) and would do it all again. I owe all who helped me a great debt of gratitude which I can never repay. You have effected me to my core. The old Marc was left in India without regret. I have told my story to many in hopes they may experience similar life saving care. They may not come but I spread the good news none the less. I have only seen my doctor once in the last year. There has been no need. At some point I would like to see a new x-ray to see what my spine looks like now but in my heart it seems insignificant next to the way I feel. It is impossible for me to tell I have parts in there. Great job. I thank you, My family thanks you and I am certain karma will reward you for the rest of your lives. I shall never forget!</p></div></div><div class="container-testimonial"><div class="wrapper-testimonial"><p class="name">Ibrahim Monita Garba</p><p class="treatment">Unilateral Total Knee Replacement and Disarticulation of Wrist and Elbow</p><p class="line"></p><p class="description">I am patient of Max Hospital, Patparganj from Nigeria.

The genuine care and affection we got at Max Healthcare is just unmatched! It was very reassuring for my family to know that while I was to go through a surgery, I was being looked after so well. It brings down the stress level so much. And in less than a week, I am feeling free. The Staff is great and the rooms are immaculate.
